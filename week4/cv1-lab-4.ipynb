    "### **Section 1: Image Alignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will develop a function that computes the affine transformation between two images. The goal is to align two supplied images from *Genoa Beach* by following a series of steps that involve detecting interest points, characterizing their local appearances, and matching these regions between the images. This process is fundamental in many computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image stitching, and motion tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall procedure is outlined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect Interest Points:**\n",
    "   - Identify key points in each image that are likely to be matched between the two images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characterize Local Appearance:**\n",
    "   - Describe the local appearance around each interest point using a region descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find Matches:**\n",
    "   - Match the region descriptors between the two images to identify corresponding points. You can use David Lowe's SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for these steps. SIFT is a powerful method for detecting and describing local features in images. For further information, refer to the [SIFT tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html) and the [SIFT class documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/d5/d3c/classcv_1_1xfeatures2d_1_1SIFT.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus):**\n",
    "   - To find the best transformation, perform the following steps:\n",
    "     - **Repeat N times:**\n",
    "       - Randomly select a set of P matched pairs from the total set of matches.\n",
    "       - Construct a matrix A and vector b using the P pairs of points. Solve for the affine transformation parameters \\((m1, m2, m3, m4, t1, t2)\\) by solving the equation \\(Ax = b\\). This equation can be solved using the pseudo-inverse \\(x = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b\\) or by using Python's Numpy package.\n",
    "       - Apply the transformation to all matched points in the first image. If the transformation is accurate, the transformed points should lie close to their corresponding points in the second image.\n",
    "       - Count the number of inliers, where inliers are defined as points from the first image that, when transformed, lie within a radius of 10 pixels from their corresponding points in the second image.\n",
    "       - If the number of inliers exceeds the best count so far, save the transformation parameters and the set of inliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualize RANSAC Performance:**\n",
    "   - Plot the two images side by side and draw lines connecting the original points in the first image with their corresponding transformed points in the second image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transform the First Image:**\n",
    "   - Use the final set of transformation parameters to transform the first image. The transformed image should align with the second image. Implement this transformation using **nearest-neighbor interpolation**. Additionally, use OpenCV's built-in function `cv2.warpAffine` to compare results. Note that nearest-neighbor interpolation involves rounding the coordinates of the transformed points, which is simpler to implement than linear interpolation.\n"
