    "### **Section 1: Neighborhood Processing for Image Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will start with an exploration of neighborhood processing techniques, which are fundamental to image processing. These techniques allow for the extraction of structural patterns such as edges and blobs, and are extensively used in tasks like image denoising and segmentation. Neighborhood or block processing is also a key component of Convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood processing involves examining the pixels surrounding a point $I(x, y)$ in an image $I$ and applying a function, $h(k, l)$, that measures specific properties or relationships within that local window. This function, $h(k, l)$, is known as the neighborhood operator or local operator, and is often implemented as a linear filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear filters compute a weighted sum of the neighboring pixel intensities and assign this sum to the pixel of interest, producing the output $I_{out}(i, j)$. These filters are typically represented as square matrices. Terms like filters, kernels, weight matrices, or masks are often used interchangeably in the literature. A kernel is a matrix that defines a neighborhood operation, such as edge detection or smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear filters are applied across the entire image using operators like correlation ($\\otimes$) and convolution ($\\ast$).\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Both operators are *linear shift-invariant* (LSI), meaning they function consistently across the image. The discrete forms of these operators are expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation (1)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{I}_{out} = I \\otimes  \\mathbf{h} \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{I}_{out}(i,j) = \\sum_{k,l}  \\mathbf{I}(i+k,j+l) \\mathbf{h}(k,l)$\n",

    "\\mathbf{I}_{out}(i,j) = \\sum_{k,l} \\mathbf{I}(i-k,j-l) \\mathbf{h}(k,l)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates neighborhood processing: a kernel or mask convolves over the input image, with each pixel intensity multiplied by the corresponding weight in the kernel. The example uses a $3x3$ averaging mask, showing the effect of filtering on the input image.\n",

    "### **Section 4: Noise in digital images**\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images are often plagued by various types of noise that can significantly degrade their quality. These imperfections might originate during the image acquisition process, where sensors introduce noise, or through user errors, such as incorrect camera settings. For example, some medical imaging modalities generate low-resolution images (e.g., 128x128 pixels) that are particularly susceptible to noise. Given the exponential increase in the number of photos taken daily, enhancing noisy or corrupted images has become a critical area of research in image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise in digital images can manifest in several ways, two of the most common being salt-and-pepper noise and additive Gaussian noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Salt-and-Pepper Noise:** This type of noise is characterized by random occurrences of black and white pixels scattered across the image. It can result from overexposure, which creates \"hot\" pixels, or from defective sensors, leading to \"dead\" pixels. These randomly placed black and white pixels resemble the appearance of salt and pepper sprinkled on the image, hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additive Gaussian Noise:** Another prevalent type of noise is additive Gaussian noise, often associated with thermal effects in the camera sensor. This noise is modeled by adding a random value to each pixel in the image. The random value, denoted by $\\epsilon$, is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation, $\\sigma$, which represents the noise level. The relationship between the original image $\\mathbf{I}(x)$ and the noisy image $\\mathbf{I}^{\\prime}(x)$ can be described by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{I}^{\\prime}(x) = \\mathbf{I}(x) + \\epsilon \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ *(Equation D)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, $\\mathbf{I}(x)$ represents the original image, and $\\mathbf{I}^{\\prime}(x)$ is the resulting image after Gaussian noise has been added. The noise $\\epsilon$ is sampled independently for each pixel from the Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\sigma$ controls the intensity of the noise. As $\\sigma$ increases, the image becomes progressively noisier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both salt-and-pepper noise and additive Gaussian noise are common in real-world imaging scenarios and require effective noise reduction techniques. In the upcoming sections, we will explore various methods for mitigating these types of noise, enhancing the quality of digital images, and ensuring that the final images are closer to their true representations."

    "Foreground-background separation is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, enabling applications such as object recognition, scene understanding, and image editing. The objective is to distinguish the main object (foreground) from the surrounding area (background) in an image. This process is essential when the foreground object needs to be isolated for further analysis or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement a simple unsupervised algorithm that leverages texture variations to segment the foreground object from the background. The assumption is that the foreground object has a distinct combination of textures compared to the background, which can be exploited for separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabor filters, known for their effectiveness in capturing texture information due to their frequency domain characteristics, will be used to analyze the texture differences within the image. By applying a collection of Gabor filters with varying scales and orientations—referred to as a *filter bank*—we can effectively distinguish between different texture patterns in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, you can see how this process works. The **left** image shows the original input image. The **middle** image displays the foreground mask, which identifies the pixels that belong to the foreground object. The **right** image shows the result of applying the foreground mask to the input image, effectively isolating the foreground object from the background.\n",
